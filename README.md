## 📊 Project Overview

###  Objectives:
- Build a robust data warehouse for sales & shipment data
- Apply machine learning to extract meaningful insights
- Enable business stakeholders to explore insights via dashboards

###  Key Features:

-  Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis** and compiled a data understanding & quality report.
-  Cleaned and preprocessed raw sales data with **feature engineering** for ML readiness.
-  Designed and implemented a **normalized star schema** in **Snowflake**.
-  Developed **ER and Schema diagrams** to visualize data structure and relationships.
-  Applied **machine learning models** to:
  - Predict **shipment status**, **order profitability**, and **sales forecast**
  - Cluster customers based on buying/shipping behavior
-  Visualized delivery performance trends and **geographic insights** using latitude/longitude data.
-  Evaluated models using **Accuracy**, **RMSE**, and **Silhouette Score**.
-  Created an **interactive dashboard** in **Power BI** for real-time business insights.
